Dog Trip: Find Your Perfect Dog Walker


This was my final fullstack project, built from scratch while self-learning Flask. I developed the entire system independently – from backend logic to UI design and database integration.

Dog Trip is a web platform that connects dog owners with reliable and professional dog walkers.
It includes user authentication, availability calendars, a review and rating system, an admin dashboard, and a smart dynamic matching algorithm.

🚀 How It Works

Dog Owners create an account and specify their location, dog size, availability, and walking preferences.

Dog Walkers register their services, including their available days, pricing, and experience level.

Our smart matching algorithm instantly finds the most suitable walkers based on location, pricing, and user ratings — ensuring a fast and personalized match.

Owners can send booking requests, which walkers can accept or decline, Ratings can be submitted after service.


🤖 Algorithm Overview
🚧 The Problem
Finding a trustworthy dog walker can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Owners often struggle to compare multiple profiles based on quality, pricing, and availability.

💡 The Solution
A smart matching engine that instantly recommends the most relevant walkers for each request, helping owners make informed decisions in seconds.

A dynamic score is calculated for each walker based on:

⭐ User rating

📍 Distance from the owner

💰 Price per walk

The top-matching walkers are automatically ranked at the top of the search results.

✅ Key Benefits
⏱️ Time Efficiency
Eliminates manual searching and reduces the need to contact multiple irrelevant service providers.

🎯 Personalized Matching
Each user receives results tailored to their specific preferences, including availability, pricing, and proximity.

📊 Smart Ranking
The most suitable walker appears first, while less relevant options are pushed down — enabling quick and confident decisions.
